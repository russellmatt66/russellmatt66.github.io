  <h3 id="lifting-not-the-meathead-discipline-youre-thinking-of">Lifting: Not the Meathead Discipline You’re Thinking Of</h3>
<p>Lifting weights is complicated. 600 is a safe figure for the number of muscles in the human body. I’m hedging here, not because we don’t know, but because not everyone has the exact same configuration. Muscles are also not the only degrees of freedom to the problem. Tendons, ligaments, soft tissue, and the motor neurons innervating the entire structure (of which there are two kinds), must also be accounted for, strictly-speaking.</p>

<p>Furthermore, differences in the characteristic lengths of individuals, e.g., leg length, torso length, wingspan, waist size, etc. means that a tailored analysis must be done to solve the dynamical problem of a specific human being lifting a weight, i.e., conservation of momentum and energy based on the evolution of the system of leverages interacting with the gravitational field of the Earth in order to perform work on an extended mass for the purpose of moving it against the local gravitational potential. Obtaining this kind of information is difficult, challenging, and expensive, to say the least.</p>

<p>Part of the progression of lifting weights is gaining an empirical understanding of your anthropometry–the technical term for the system of measurements characterizing your physiognomy. As a rank beginner, you’ll be gripping and ripping the deadlift, butt-winking your squats or leaving them high, and bouncing the bench press off of your chest or erroneously bringing it down to your clavicle.</p>

<h3 id="the-six-stages">The Six Stages</h3>
<p>There are six levels that characterize an individual’s progression as a weightlifter:
\(\begin{enumeration}
\item Beginner
\item Novice
\item Intermediate I
\item Intermediate II
\item Advanced
\item Elite
\end{enumeration}\)
This partitioning is not arbitrary. To attach a meaningful metric to each stage, lifters use $\textit{strength coefficients}$, the ratio of a lift’s weight to the lifter’s bodyweight for a given lift,</p>

\[C = \frac{LW}{BW}\]

<p>This partitioning is not a guarantee. When you dive into the world of lifting, and acquire a measure of experience, before long you will encounter the term “lifetime intermediate”. This moniker refers to the many lifters that spend long enough in the gym as a novice that they make it out of that early stage–as the linear strength progression available to an untrained human all but guarantees–but never develop the habits that can take one to the advanced level.</p>

<h3 id="beginner">Beginner</h3>

<h3 id="novice">Novice</h3>

<h3 id="intermediate-i">Intermediate I</h3>

<h3 id="intermediate-ii">Intermediate II</h3>

<h3 id="advanced">Advanced</h3>

<h3 id="elite">Elite</h3>
<p>This stage deserves its own category, if for no other reason than because it is perhaps the most difficult to talk about. Why is that? Well, because it requires us to face an unfair truth about life: it’s all about genetics. This painful reality is first faced by young men when puberty hits. Some of them grow immediately, shooting up in height, receiving muscles, and neuromuscular power, that allows them to begin dominating at sports like basketball, or football. Other young men don’t, and they unfortunately endure bullying and abuse, finding themselves shoved aside and neglected, or just treated like an afterthought by their peers.</p>

<p>The silver lining in this bleak picture is that every one of these able-bodied young men, and indeed young women too–who I have not mentioned solely because I do not feel it is my place to try and speak about their experience when I have not lived it–has the potential to reach an advanced level of strength ability by the time they graduate college.</p>

<p>The difference between being an Intermediate and Advanced lifter boils down to knowledge, discipline, and the implementation of these two over a period of 5 - 10 years. However, the difference between being an Advanced and Elite athlete boils down to genetics.</p>
