### What is Lifting?
"Lifting" means different things depending on who you ask. 

To a powerlifter, it means the Squat, Bench, and Deadlift, as heavy as you can go while still getting white lights for your form from the majority of the judges. 

To an olympic weightlifter, it means the graceful elegance and raw power of the Clean&Jerk, and Snatch, with a nod towards the Squat and Deadlift as useful assistance movements. 

To a bodybuilder, it means machines that possess a fixed tension curve, dumbbells, and partial reps so that you can pump up exactly the muscles that you want to in order to create the most aesthetic package for display on stage (if you're a smart bodybuilder, it also means heavy barbell movements like the Squat, Bench, and Deadlift to build strength and power so that you can move more weight, and get a greater pump, on the machines and dumbbells). 

To a physicist, it means doing work on an extended massive body in order to move it through space against a gravitational field, thereby changing its potential energy at the cost of the expenditure of your own chemical energy.
