Perturbation theory is one of the most important tools in the toolchest of a physicist. The governing equations of physics, i.e., electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, are systems of coupled, nonlinear, [partial differential equations](../math/2024-07-17_pdes). Analytical solutions to these are few, and far between, with entire careers being dedicated to, and legacies made on the back of, obtaining just one to a meaningful application. In response to this, physicists seek insight into the behavior of physical systems by instead **linearizing** these equations.
