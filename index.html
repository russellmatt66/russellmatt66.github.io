<h1>Bio</h1>
<p>My name is Matt. Currently, I live in the PNW area and study plasma physics at the University of Washington . Besides spending my time trying to believe the lies 
  of Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) I'm also a member of the Aeronautics & Astronautics CubeSat Team (AACT) where I lead the communications (COM) subsystem. 
  My curse is that I have a wide variety of interests but I try to channel them through the combination of Maxwell's equations and computers in order to stay focused 
  and get things done. I love physics, particularly electromagnetics as you might have guessed, but at heart I am an engineer. </p>
