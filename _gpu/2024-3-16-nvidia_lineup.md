# Introduction 
This post is the first in a planned series which will completely cover the lineup of GPUs that NVIDIA offers. This collection spans multiple scales, from the embedded Jetson line, desktop GTX and RTX cards, all the way to datacenter, and leadership-class HPC cluster, accelerators such as the A100. 

# CUDA 
No discussion of NVIDIA hardware is complete without first talking about the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform.
