&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Race conditions are one of the fundamental differences between writing sequential programs, and parallel ones. The canonical illustration of what they are is based on a parallel computation of pi by numerically integrating the expression,

$$
\begin{equation}
\int_{-1}^{1} \sqrt{1 - x^{2}} dx
\end{equation}
$$

The function $y = \sqrt{1 - x^{2}}$ over the domain $[-1, 1]$ describes the upper semi-circle of the unit circle, so integrating it accumulates an area of $\frac{\pi}{2}$.
