&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, and welcome to my personal website! I am a CUDA C/C++ programmer with a master's degree from the University of Washington where I studied computational plasma physics, and won a parallel programming competition.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you will find technical articles on subjects that I am passionate about: Nuclear Fusion, GPU Computing, the Physics of Weightlifting, and More. Why should you care? Because, I didn't suffer through graduate school for nothing, and I hope to share some of what I know in a way that makes it presentable. Be warned, there WILL be mathematics, and there WILL be code. It is impossible to convey physics correctly without expressing mathematics, as the physics IS the math, and it is a difficult challenge to talk about programming without showing any code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is intimidating, please accept my apologies. I know that one of the most frustrating things about my time in higher education studying physics was the moments when seemingly complicated steps in a calculation, or derivation, were glossed over without comment by the instructor. Those of us who could reverse-engineer the product or chain rule or perform integration by parts, in our heads, on the fly, stayed in the game, while the students that could not fell off, so to speak. All that is to say, that I understand any reticence which may accompany my earlier mention.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my goal here is to create a serious technical blog full of vector calculus, partial differential equations, linear algebra, and performant numerical code. Building up all the knowledge required to understand these fields from a zero-point background will unfortunately not be possible, but the Internet is full of resources, and tutorials to help one learn these disciplines.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you've made it here, and are wondering why you should bother continuing, at the very least it is because there will be beautiful pictures of fluid plasmas to enjoy. Also, while I cannot take the time to communicate, in complete and exhaustive detail, the particulars of every piece of mathematics or physics which MathJAX will let me render, I do have elite talent at parallel programming, and I will be more than happy when presenting the codes that I have written, to explain how performant they are, and why. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I am an avid weightlifter, and fitness enthusiast. My goal is one day to squat and deadlift over 600lbs, bench over 400, run a sub-5 40 yard dash, and dunk a basketball. The first bit of original work I ever did as a physicist was to prove mathematically the adage in strength sports that "Mass Moves Mass". I have spent a good deal of my bandwidth becoming knowledgeable in the biomechanics, nutrition, and exercise science required to implement a competent strength training program, something which in my view is critical to one's life, and I will be more than happy to record what I know in this digital format so that hopefully others may start their fitness journey off on the right foot.   

Please enjoy!
