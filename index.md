Hello, and welcome to my personal website!

Here you will find articles written on physics, mathematics, computer science, and programming by someone with a graduate education in computational plasma physics from a top 10 school who specialized in high-performance computing, and was, in some sense, "best-in-class" at it. 

The topics are things that I am interested in like electromagnetics, nuclear fusion, weightlifting, basketball, and high-performance computing, as well as general musings about physics, life, and stories related to my time in grad school that I've accrued, and wish to pass on. 

Please enjoy!
