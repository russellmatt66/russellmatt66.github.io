&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, and welcome to my personal website!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you will find articles on physics, mathematics, computer science, and programming, written by someone with a graduate education in computational plasma physics from a top 10 school, who specialized in high-performance computing, and was, in some sense, "best-in-class" at it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topics are technical and scientific subjects that I am passionate about, like electromagnetics, nuclear fusion, computer architecture, GPUs, high-performance computing, deep learning, and weightlifting. 

Please enjoy!
