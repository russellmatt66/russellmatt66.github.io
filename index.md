&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, and welcome to my personal website! I am a computational scientist who specializes in accelerating applications with GPUs, and optimizing GPU kernels and runtimes, particularly with CUDA C/C++. I have a master's degree from the University of Washington where I studied computational plasma physics, and won a parallel programming competition at [one of the best graduate schools for computer science in the US](1).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you will find technical articles written by me on subjects that I am passionate about. The aim of these articles is to showcase high-performing numerical simulations that I have written, physics that I have done, and problems that I have solved. My, somewhat ambitious, goal is to write these articles in a way that would allow an expert to read them without growing bored, and a novice to follow along without growing confused or frustrated by them. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Please enjoy!
