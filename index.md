&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, and welcome to my personal website! I am a parallel programmer, and computational scientist, who specializes in accelerating applications with GPUs by optimizing GPU kernels and runtimes, using a healthy mixture of CUDA, C, C++, and Python. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an M.Sc. from the University of Washington where I studied high-performance computing, computational plasma physics, fusion energy, and won a parallel programming competition at [one of the best graduate schools for computer science in the US](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings), so I have started this website as an effort to compile all that I have learned, and continue to learn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here you will find technical articles written by me on subjects that I am passionate about. The aim of these articles is to showcase high-performing numerical simulations that I have written, and explore the theory behind them. My, somewhat ambitious, goal is to write these articles in a way that would allow an expert to read them without growing bored, and a novice to follow along without growing confused or frustrated by them. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're interested in the code behind these articles, then please check out my [github](https://github.com/russellmatt66) where you can find the source open to your perusual :)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Please enjoy!
