&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, and welcome to my personal website! I am a parallel programmer, and computational scientist, who specializes in accelerating applications with GPUs by optimizing GPU kernels and runtimes, using a healthy mixture of CUDA, C, C++, and Python. I've also discovered [Bennett Vorticity](documents/BennettVorticity.pdf), which is the novel phenomenon of a family of analytic SFS Z-Pinch equilibria whose temperature profile is cubic, and whose SFS state requires a minimum pinch length that goes to zero as the pinch radius does. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a [mixed theory](documents/MixedBennettVortex.pdf) which I have discovered because this family of equilibria hinges on distributing the Bennett nonlinearity between the density and flow profiles, and so long as the plasma current density equals the current density of the cubic pure-flow vortex, then the equilibrium will be analytic no matter how the nonlinearity was distributed.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an M.Sc. from the University of Washington where I studied high-performance computing, computational plasma physics, fusion energy, and won a parallel programming competition at [one of the best graduate schools for computer science in the US](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings), so I have started this website as an effort to compile all that I have learned, and continue to learn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here you will find technical articles written by me on subjects that I am passionate about. The aim of these articles is to showcase high-performing numerical simulations that I have written, and explore the theory behind them. My, somewhat ambitious, goal is to write these articles in a way that would allow an expert to read them without growing bored, and a novice to follow along without growing confused or frustrated by them. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're interested in the code behind these articles, then please check out my [github](https://github.com/russellmatt66) where you can find the source open to your perusual :)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Please enjoy!
