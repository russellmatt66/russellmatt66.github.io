### Introduction   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plasma physics is the study of the behavior of plasmas. This study frequently begins with the question "What is a plasma?" Roughly-speaking, it is a gas of charged particles. These particles interact primarily through long-range electromagnetic forces, and all-together, can exhibit a wide spectrum of behavior across multiple scales. As a collection of charged particles, understanding of a plasma's behavior can be gleaned by studying the motion of charged particles in an electromagnetic field. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many plasmas of interest, this motion is governed by Newtonian mechanics subject to the impact of the Lorentz Force,
$$
\vec{F} = q_{s}(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their multiscale nature is a trademark of plasmas. There is never just one thing happening in a plasma.
