I have previously written about [index notation](../math/2024-07-15_indexnotation). In my estimation, it is the single most useful tool that one can have in their arsenal if they wish to do vector calculus seriously. If you know index notation then feel free to continue, but if you do not, please follow the link above and read the information where it leads, before continuing. Index notation is an immensely useful shorthand for writing vector equations that allows you to [derive vector identities](../math/2024-07-15_indexnotation#deriving-vector-identities) such as 

$$
\begin{equation}
\curl \curl \vec{B} = \nabla (\div \vec{B}) - \laplacian \vec{B}
\end{equation}
$$

which would otherwise require rote memorization, or a tedious amount of algebra.
