#### The History of MHD
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnetohydrodynamics, MHD for short, is the study of electrically-conducting fluids. Strictly-speaking, the study dates back as far as to when people first began playing with liquid mercury, although it was Chandrasekhar's investigations into astrophysics in the early-20th century which really began the theoretical study of the discipline.   

#### Deriving MHD
There are many flavors of MHD. 

#### Two-Fluid MHD

#### Single-Fluid MHD

#### Ideal MHD

#### Resistive MHD

#### Extended MHD
