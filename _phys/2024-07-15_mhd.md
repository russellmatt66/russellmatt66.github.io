#### A Brief History of MHD
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnetohydrodynamics, MHD for short, is the study of electrically-conducting fluids. Strictly-speaking, the study dates back as far as to when people first began playing with liquid mercury, although it was Chandrasekhar's investigations into astrophysics in the early-20th century which really began the theoretical study of the discipline.   

#### Deriving MHD
There are many flavors of MHD. At the lowest level, every one of them begins by taking moments of a kinetic equation with a suitable closure.  

#### Two-Fluid MHD

#### Single-Fluid MHD

#### Ideal MHD

#### Resistive MHD

#### Hall MHD

#### Extended MHD
