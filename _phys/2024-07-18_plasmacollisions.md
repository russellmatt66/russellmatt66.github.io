<!-- Introduction -->
#### Coulomb Collisions
A plasma is a gas of charged particles. These particles zip around, radiating electromagnetic fields in their wake, and being buffeted by the wake of other particles. There is a famous metaphor in [plasma turbulence](./2024-07-18_plasmaturbulence) that, "each pea in the soup acts as soup for the other peas". Essentially, what this boils down to saying is that each charged particle in the plasma, because of collective effects, acts like plasma for the other charged particles.

#### Long-Range vs. Short-Range
Short-range collisions in a plasma are rare. Much more common are "glancing" collisions that perturb the particle trajectories via long-range interaction with electromagnetic fields.     

#### Collisionless Plasmas

#### Collision-dominated Plasmas

#### Collisionality
Spend enough time around plasma physicists, and inevitably you will begin to hear them discuss the "collisionality" of a plasma.
