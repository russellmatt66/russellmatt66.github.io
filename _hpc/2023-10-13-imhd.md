title: High-Performance Ideal MHD Plasma Simulation
collection: hpc
---
In this article, I will describe how to implement a simulation of a fluid plasma based on the Ideal MHD model that can achieve performance commensurate with the Cray-1 $(1976)$, one of the most successful supercomputers ever sold, on data volumes as large as $31$ GB.
